## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites:
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your machine. Install the necessary libraries using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/supervised-deep-learning-algorithms.git
cd supervised-deep-learning-algorithms
```

## Usage
### Running an Algorithm:
Each algorithm has its own script. For example, to run Logistic Regression:
```
python algorithms/logistic_regression.py
```
To run a Deep Learning Algorithm, such as a CNN:
```
python deep_learning/cnn.py
```
### Visualising Results:
Use the --plot flag to visualise the results:
```
python algorithms/<algorithm_name>.py --plot
```
